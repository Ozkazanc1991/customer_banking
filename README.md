### Python Challenge 2 Assignment 2

The following assignment I am sumbitting is the second python challenge (assingment 2) for the OSU AI Bootcamp. 

Inside the python files are the codes for this assignment, followed along with comments explaining each step/line of code provided by the challenger files. The customer_banking.py file will walk you through the savings & cd account example. 

The following links below are the sources I referenced to provide me a foundation to help me write my python code for this assingment.
